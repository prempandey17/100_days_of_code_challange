/* Java Hashset
In computer science, a set is an abstract data type that can store certain values, without any particular order, 
and no repeated values(Wikipedia). {1,2,3} is an example of a set, but {1,2,2} is not a set. Today you will learn 
how to use sets in java by solving this problem.
You are given n pairs of strings. Two pairs (a,b) and (c,d) are identical if a=c and b=d. That also implies (a,b) 
is not same as (b,a). After taking each pair as input, you need to print number of unique pairs you currently have.
Note: Brute force solution will not earn full points.
Hints: Solve Java Comparator problem first!
Input Format
In the first line, there will be an integer T denoting number of pairs. Each of the next T lines will contain two 
strings seperated by a single space.
Constraints:
1<=T<=100000
Length of each string is atmost 5 and will consist lower case letters only.
The testcases were generated randomly.
Output Format
Print T lines. In the ith line, print number of unique pairs you have after taking ith pair as input.
Sample Input

Sample Output
