/*
  HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

   1. Every student receives a grade in the inclusive range from 1 to 100.
   2. Any grade less than 30 is a failing grade. 

     

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's grade according to these rules:

  1.If the difference between the grade and the next multiple of 5 is less than 3 , round up to the next multiple of 5.
  2.If the value of grade  is less than 38 , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

Examples

  1. grade = 84 round to85 (85 - 84 is less than 3)
  2. grade = 29 do not round (result is less than 40)
  3. grade = do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)

Given the initial value of  grade for each of Sam's n students, write code to automate the rounding 
process. 

Function Description

Complete the function gradingStudents in the editor below.

gradingStudents has the following parameter(s):

    int grades[n]: the grades before rounding

Returns

    int[n]: the grades after rounding as appropriate

Input Format
